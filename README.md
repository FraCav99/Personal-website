# 🛠 Technologies
Personal Website Portfolio made with:
<ul>
  <li>React ⚛</li>
  <li>SCSS 🖌</li>
  <li>Webpack 5</li>
</ul>

# :dart: Goals of this project
Apart from making a personal protfolio, I wanted to test my knowledge of everything i know so far, from how to set a complete project with React without using React-CLI
and how to set a webpack configuration file, with all its loader and plugins.

This helped me to understand how React-CLI set everything for us under the hood!
